\section{Introduction}

In this report, we describe how we constructed a model to predict
the number of incoming call to the AXA french center. The dataset
on which the prediction is made consists in training data from the
years 2011 and 2012, giving the number of calls depending on the date
and a number of parameters such as the area of expertise of the call
and the state of the call center. It comes up with another complementary
set of data concerning weather information in France, which is supposed
to have an influence over the number of accidents and thus incoming
calls to AXA. We divided our work in -- parts. First, the dataset
has to be preprocessed to be used efficiently. Then we use this data
to create features for our model. After this feature engineering step
we train a model and use it to predict the number of calls asked in
the submission file. We also evaluate our model using cross-validation
techniques.


\section{Preprocessing}

The data comes in two types of csv files : meteo\_2011.csv, meteo\_2012.csv
and train\_2011\_2012.csv. The main training dataset contains multiple
informations on the incoming calls to AXA's centers in France. The
number of incoming calls we have to predict, CSPL\_RECEIVED\_CALLS
is one of the 86 columns of the file. For each value of DATE and ASS\_ASSIGNMENT
(the field of competence to which the call is assigned), the model
has to predict the number of incoming calls for the three next days.

We used pandas library to read the files as databases objects. The
main advantage of pandas' read\_csv function is that it allows us
to read only the columns we are interessted in, thus saving much computation
time. 

For the training dataset, we keep the columns 'DATE', 'ASS\_ASSIGNMENT',
'CSPLRECEIVED\_CALLS' and 'DAY\_OFF'. We use this last column to eliminate
data corresponding to non worked days in AXA. We then group the data
by summing the number of calls having the same date and assignment
values. 

The meteo dataset consists in rows giving information at a given date
for a some location - city and department ($\simeq$region) number
- in France. From this, we extracted the number of french departements
undergoing negative temperaures and number of them with rain.
